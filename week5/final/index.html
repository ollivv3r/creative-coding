    <p> This piece of art decipts a city with the sky changing colors as the sun moves across the sky. I wanted to create something that was simple but fun to look at. This piece of art does not have any deep meaning. I was almost 100% successful in creating exactly what I wanted, other than a few minor things I could not figure out how to change or fix. The sun was supposed to rotate seamlessly without any duplicates. Since I could not figure out how to do this, I made it so that the sun changes colors as is moves across the sky. Another thing I could not figure out how to fix was the boxes appearing in front of the city for a split second and then disappearing. They were only supposed to appear behind the silhouette of the city.  </p>
